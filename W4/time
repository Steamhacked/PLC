time.h: provides structure to represent time, function to represent and store dates, time computed in processor clocks (ticks) then converted to seconds
  Macros:
    CLOCKS_PER_SEC -> ticks per second 
    struct tm -> stores specific date, including: seconds, minutes, hours, day, month, year
    time_t -> represents date as unsigned integer/long
    clock_t -> represents number of ticks passed since the start of the program

    clock_t -> extremely precise, but gets full fast (after around 72 minuteS?)
    struct tm & time_t -> equally imprecise
    struct tm -> more comprehendible
    time_t -> easier to use for mathematic operations

    a lot of formatting for various representations on the output
