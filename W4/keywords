static - global variables/functions, but restricted to the same file, OR
for local variables -> stored in data segment, value is kept between each function invokation

extern - allows to use a variable/function declared in another file, within the current file

union - similar to struct in most of the ways except storage,

union -> stores elements within the same chunk of memory = size of biggest element stored, each elements beginning address is shared

enum value = {VALUE1, VALUE2, VALUE3};
enum value myVar = VALUE1;

typedef enum {RED, GREEN, BLUE} color;
color chosenColor = RED;

every possible value in enum has number assigned (starts from 0)
