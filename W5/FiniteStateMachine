Finite State Machine (FSM) - is a mathematical model used to represent systems:
  that have a finite number of possible states
  & can transition between these states based on given inputs

FSM can be represented as a graph (state diagram)

Used in wide variety of applications

FSM consists of:
  Finite set of States
  Finite set of inputs/actions
  Starting State
  Transition function
  Finite Set of Stopping States (subset of states)
