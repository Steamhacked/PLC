iostream, fstream, ofstream, ifstream

ifstream:  -> works if file exists, > reads from the beginning, > uses getline(), > file is implicitly opened, > need to close the file manually
ofstream: -> creates new file, > overwrites content, > file is implicitly opened, > need to close the file manually

when ifstream/ofstream is created: a variable ifstream inp; is created > call open(): inp.open("file.txt");

fstream: fstream handler; > handler.open("filename", modes);

ifstream:
  string line;
  ifstream myFile("file");
  while(myFile>>line){
    cout<<"line: "<<line<<endl;
  }
  myFile.close();
