class Vector3D: public Vector2D{
  public:
    Vector3D(float x, float y, float z);
  private:
    float m_z;
};

Constructor .cpp:

Vector3D::Vector3D(float x, float y, float z): Vector2D(x, y), m_z(z){}

Private classes cannot be accessed from parent class, 

Overriding:
Parent::method(){/*overriding*/}

(C++ lacks "super" keyword, allows for multiple inheritance)

Multiple Inheritance Ambuguity, if there are 2 parents that have function with the same name:

c.function(); will produce error
c.Parent::function1();

Same with Attributes:

Parent::m_x
