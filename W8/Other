Strings exist in c++
Concatenated with + operator
Changing substring works: e.g.: str[0] = 'h' -> will not cause segfault
.size() instead of strlen()

bool -> boolean type (true/false)

Arrays:

int array[3] = {10, 20, 30};
int *array2 = new int[3];
delete[] must be used on array2

SizeOf array is still not completely reliable, size must be tracked manually

const:

int x = 10;
conts int *ptr = &x; // value at address is constant, address is not
ptr++; // works

int* const ptr = &x; // address is constant, value at address can be modified

const int* const ptr; //both cannot be modified

int Vector2D::changeX(float x) const {...} -> const guarantees that nothing is modified inside within the instance -> v1.changeX(3.0f) -> doesnt work

const int Vector2D::changeX(float x) {...} -> const return type, whatever is returned is treated as const
